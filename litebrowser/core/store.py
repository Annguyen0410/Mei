"""Versioned JSON stores: locking, atomic writes and upgrades in one place.

Every service used to re-implement "read the file, normalise it, write it back",
and each store carried its own idea of versioning (or none). Changing a store's
shape therefore had no upgrade path, and a newer build reading an older profile
silently reinterpreted the data.

A store is described once:

    PLAN_STORE = StoreSpec(
        name="personal_plan.json",
        version=PLAN_VERSION,
        default=_default_plan,
    )

and then read/written through :func:`read_store` / :func:`write_store`, which:

* take the per-profile lock (the profile has one writer, always);
* write atomically via ``storage_utils.write_json``;
* stamp the schema version on every write;
* upgrade older payloads through the stepwise registry in ``core/migrations.py``
  and persist the upgraded payload exactly once;
* refuse to rewrite a payload written by a *newer* build (no silent downgrade).

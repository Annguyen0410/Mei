"""One zip that makes a bug report actionable — and safe to hand over.

A report that says "it broke" cannot be debugged. A report that carries the log,
the exact versions of every moving part and the *shape* of the profile stores
usually can, and the person sending it should not have to decide which files are
private.

So the bundle is deliberately evidence, not data:

* **included** — the tail of ``mei.log``, Python/platform/app versions, and for
  each store in the profile its size, modification time, schema version and how
  many records it holds;
* **excluded by construction** — note text, task and event titles, planner
  contents, bookmarks and history entries, passwords, vault contents, AI index
  and sync token.

The only thing that can carry user text is the log tail itself (Mei logs page
titles and URLs at debug level), which ``README.txt`` inside the archive states
plainly, so the sender can read it before sharing.

What this is
  Evidence for a bug report: versions, the shape of your profile stores, and the
  tail of the application log.

What it does NOT contain
  Note text, task/event titles, planner contents, bookmarks, browsing history,
  passwords, vault files, your AI index or your sync token. The inventory records
  sizes, schema versions and record counts only.

What to check before sharing
  logs/mei.log is the real log. Mei writes page titles and URLs there at debug
  level, so it can name the sites you had open. Read it (or trim it) if that
  matters to you.

Where to send it
  Attach it to an issue at https://github.com/Annguyen0410/Mei/issues
